pwstore is a password management tool, by which I mean it supports password
creation and storage.  Planned interfaces are a CLI (which will be developed
first) and X11 (to follow).  The X11 interface will be designed to simplify
passing passwords into virtual machines, focusing on the Qemu mode of
operation.

*** ALL USERS PLEASE NOTE ***

This is the site of former repository of a tool called pwstore that was
formerly in lisp.  Henceforth, the lisp tool will be referred to as
"pwstore.lisp".  It is deprecated.  The new tool ("pwstore.hs" for
differentiation purposes) will have a superset of its features.  I will
attempt to keep compatibility, but where such would impede development, it
will be forgone.

*** UPDATE ***

pwstore.hs has eclipsed the feature set of pwstore.lisp.  All users please
migrate.  pwstore.lisp is fully depricated.
