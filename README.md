haskey is a password management tool, by which I mean it supports password
creation and storage.  Planned interfaces are a CLI (which will be developed
first) and X11 (to follow).  The X11 interface will be designed to simplify
passing passwords into virtual machines, focusing on the Qemu mode of
operation.
